# DocPlanner
This project develops a RESTful API in C# for a doctor's appointment booking system. It enables patients to view and book available slots weekly, handling slot management and work periods. The focus is on clean, efficient code with a basic UI for demonstration.

The project involves developing a software application for booking doctor's appointments. 
The core component is a RESTful API, written in C#, which interfaces with a slot service to manage the availability of appointment slots. 
Patients can view available slots on a weekly basis and book appointments, but they do not directly interact with the work periods; this is handled by the API. 
The application also includes a basic user interface, like Swagger or a simple custom UI, to demonstrate the API's functionality. 
The focus is on clean, simple, and maintainable code, with robust error handling and unit testing. 
The project prioritizes backend functionality and code quality over UI design, as the UI is mainly to showcase that the system works.
